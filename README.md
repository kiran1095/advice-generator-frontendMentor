## My process

- Fetched the API data using Jquery ajax().
- Design mark-up is completed using flex. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox.
- Jquery.

### What I learned

    - Got better understanding with usage of css Flexbox and Jquery.

### Continued development

    - Got better at using width and measurement units to support responsiveness, but still think I need more practise at using measurements like rem, vh, etc., to support better responsiveness.
    - Got better understanding of params in jqury Ajax method.
